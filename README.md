# Ai-Chatbot

To create a **GitHub README** for a chatbot project using the Gemini Pro Free API, you want to ensure that it's clear, structured, and informative. Here’s a sample structure for your documentation:

---

# Conversational Q&A Chatbot

This project is a simple **Conversational Q&A Chatbot** built using the **Gemini Pro Free API**. The chatbot can answer user questions using natural language processing by querying the API.

## Features
- Accepts user questions via a web interface
- Uses the Gemini Pro API to generate answers
- Lightweight backend with Flask (Python)
- Optional frontend for interacting with the chatbot in real time

## Prerequisites

To run this chatbot locally, you'll need:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** (for the backend)
- **requests** (for API calls)
- An API key from Gemini Pro

### Install the Required Python Packages

Before starting, you need to install the dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install flask requests
```

## Setting up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-gemini-pro.git
cd chatbot-gemini-pro
```

### 2. Obtain a Gemini Pro API Key
Sign up for an API key from the [Gemini Pro website](https://www.geminipro.com). Once you have your key, store it securely. 

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

For security, it's better to set your API key as an environment variable. You can add this to your shell configuration or a `.env` file:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Run the Application

Once everything is set up, run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You can open this URL in your browser and interact with the chatbot.

## API Integration

### Querying the Gemini Pro API

The chatbot sends user questions to Gemini Pro's API and gets a response back. Here’s an overview of how the API is called in the code:

1. User submits a question through the frontend.
2. Flask handles the incoming request and calls the `query_gemini()` function.
3. This function sends a POST request to Gemini Pro's `/v1/chat` endpoint with the question in the request body.
4. The API response is parsed and sent back to the frontend.

Here's a simplified version of the function:

```python
def query_gemini(question):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {GEMINI_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    data = {
        "prompt": question,
        "max_tokens": 100,
        "temperature": 0.5
    }
    response = requests.post(GEMINI_API_URL, json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()
```

## Project Structure

```
.
├── app.py               # Main Flask backend
├── static/
│   └── chatbot.html      # Frontend HTML (if any)
├── templates/
│   └── index.html        # Optional HTML for rendering chatbot UI
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Frontend (Optional)

If you’d like to add a simple web interface, you can use the provided HTML file in the `static/` directory. This file allows users to submit questions directly from their browser.

### Sample HTML Form

```html
<form action="/chat" method="POST">
    <label for="question">Ask a question:</label>
    <input type="text" id="question" name="question">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Example Request
After filling in the form, the backend will receive the question and pass it to the Gemini Pro API. The answer will be displayed in the browser.

## Deployment

You can deploy this chatbot on any hosting service such as:
- **Heroku**: Simple cloud deployment platform
- **Vercel**: Easily deploy both frontend and backend
- **AWS or GCP**: More customizable cloud platforms for production

### Deploying to Heroku

1. Install the Heroku CLI:
   ```bash
   curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Create a Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create chatbot-gemini
   ```

3. Push the code to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

4. Set your environment variable on Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   ```

Your bot will now be live on a public URL provided by Heroku.
